Physical address is an actual address in the main memory which we can access 
directly unlike a virtual address. It is often not enough physical addresses
to provide for all the programs and here we make some illusion of bigger main memory
using virtual addresses that are greater in their quantity. 
Virtual addresses are grouped in pages that form a virtual address space. For these pages 
a special page table is stored to map some pages to some group of physical addresses
in the main memory. Typically, user programs cannot access just physical memory, they
access virtual locations.
