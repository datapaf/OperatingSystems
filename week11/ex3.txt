For the program 1 we have two lines of hello as an input.
The line buffer contained "Hello" and after forking two processes had
their the same buffers with "Hello". After putting "\n" both processes
have their buffers filled and the printing happens. 

For the program 2 we have one line of hello and two empty lines as an input.
The line buffer contained "Hello" and after putting "\n" the buffer became filled, 
the printing happened. After that the forking goes and two processes had
their the same empty buffers. After putting "\n" both processes
have their buffers filled and the printing of empty strings happens.
