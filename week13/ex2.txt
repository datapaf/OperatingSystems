Recovery is better to choose in case 
we want program to proceed its work 
and the performance is important for us

Prevention is chosen when it is possible 
to make the system such that one of the conditions
for deadlocks does not hold and we have to guarantee
reliability of the system

Avoidance can be chosen when we cannot afford 
deadlocks and at the same time we are ready to
scarfice performance of the system.
