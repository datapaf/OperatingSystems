	Increasing Hit/Miss ratio:
The Hit/Miss ratio is going to increase if the sequence
of necessary pages contains pages numbers that repeat many
times immediately after their introduction(numbers are clustering)
Example: 3 3 3 3 3 3 4 4 4 4 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1

	Decreasing Hit/Miss ratio:
The Hit/Miss ratio is going to decrease if the sequence
of necessary pages contains pages numbers that repeat as
rare as possible(numbers are widely spreaded)
Example: 5 4 3 2 1 9 8 7 6 5 12 20 5 14 49 9
